  <h1>Bringing back hobbies</h1>
  <p>My name is Deloris Onwuka. I work for the government, 
    and I want to study to get my phd in economics. I hope to one day be
focused on technology focused financial products, and capital raising for
mid-sized corporations in M&A. So it's no surprise that I spend most of my
free time reading about finance, or statistics.

    Whatever is left of my day is spent watching movies. These days I am
    theorizing double features endlessly. And it started with a book by Mel
    Brooks, the filmmaker. Now I didn't watch a film by Mel Brooks to quell
    those passing thoughts. I saw a documentary about Albert Brooks! Albert 
    Brooks whose film I randomly caught before my Criterion trial ended, called 
    "Modern Romance" What an uncomfortable film. In fact it so causes the insides
    to twist that I guess it left a lasting impression enough on me to consider
    watching it again, and I did. Over several weekends many hypotheses were tested.
    I did that documentary paired with my (only) favorite noir, "Sweet Smell of Success"
    And then it became about twisting my roommate into joining by offering up
    something so ingeniously disquieting that he had to see it. 

    Now I am translating this love because I feel a bit like a good backyard
    engineer--I've just got to get the video camera out, and start taping. Mostly
    I hope I have engineered a couple of good weekends spent doing absolutely nothing for myself,
    and for you dear reader. That are filled to the brim with good stories. I hope you 
    will heed the call, and maybe even indulge in a triple, or quadruple feature of
    your own masterminding. With lots of going out, and into nature in between because
    we don't believe a film has to be watched straight through around here. Feel free 
    to blame short-form entertainment for that one. Now please enjoy, and write me 
    if you feel like it!
