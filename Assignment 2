        Ever since I was a kid I have always loved watching as many movies as I can! 
        Below you'll find a list of films I watched last weekend lest you should chicken out 
        on the double feature for fear that there might be too few hours in a day. 
        It may shock you these pairings. However for the time being I am choosing to extrapolate 
        from it only a childish playfulness combined with the often unbelievably, and occasionally
        too perfect summation that is screenwriting. Positing that I am somehow simply drawn 
        to juxtapositions for reasons perhaps better answered to by my psychoanalyst. This is for you, 
        however! Indulge with me. Barely lift your head off of the sofa, or your body.

        <li>American Psycho</li>
        <li>A Little Princess</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Zootopia</li>
    </ul>

        These films also fit the bill for not appearing to go together.
        Although in action they provide a lighthearted, and energetic 
        space that doesn't take itself too seriously. Altogether it was a 
        great weekend!

        I occasionally take suggestions for genres, or specific auteurs to try. 9/10 
        times I will ultimately choose Pedro Almodóvar plus someone over anyything.
