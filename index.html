        I love watching as many movies as I can! This is what I watched this weekend.
        It might surprise you, this pairing, but I must extrapolate that I am somehow 
        feeling drawn to juxtapositions in my latest viewings.

        These films also fit the bill for not appearing to go together.
        Although in action they provide a lighthearted, and adult energetic 
        space that doesn't take itself too seriously. Altogether it was a 
        great weekend!
